2. As a user born in the 80's I have lots of fun playing this game, easily on a website, and remembering the old days when technology wasn't so developed and you needed a gadget for each game.
3. As a developer I can get ideas for my own project and I can send my feedback to the owner.
4. As a user that mistyped the address, he will be redirected to a 404 page which will contain information that the page does not exist and he will have options to go back.

### Site Owner Goals
---
1. To showcase my skills in Html, CSS, Javascript, API's
2. To have an attractive and easy to use site.
3. To have a site that is responsive on all devices and easy to navigate.
4. To have all the information easy to reach.

### Scope
---
The scope of the project is defined by:

* Navigation bar, for a simple navigation of the website
* Footer available in all the website's pages, with link to my social page.
* Modal which displays rules and info about the game.
* Contact form, linked to emailjs API for queries and feedback.
* Favicon to help users identify the website easier.
* Snake game, to enjoy an old school game.

Features to be built in future releases:

### Design Choices
---
* The goal for this site was to create a simple and easy to use platform, that contains a classic game that showcases javascript ckills , alongside a contact form linked to emailjs.

### Colors
---
Main colors are **Green** / **White** and **Red**. Most of the website is **Green** and it's pallete **White** was used for the text, for a good contrast, the **Red** color is used for the logo, to bring it forward and stand out.

### Fonts
---
I have used Righteous as the font for the whole website. Cool design and works well with the whole site.

### Structure
---
In the upper part there's a navigation bar, which contains the Help and Contact button. On the index page, we have the **Logo**, underneath it we have the game box where all the action happens and under it, we have the score and information about the status of the game.
Then The **Help** page, displays a modal with rules of the game and a close button.
Next there's the **Contact** page that showcases a contact form with name, email and feedback, wich is linked to emailjs, for queries and feedback.
In the **Footer** we have the copyright and my name which is linked to my social's.
